# Babel

Babel is a very nice, cleanly built es6 to es5 transpiler. It generates significantly more readable code than other popular transpilers like traceur, has full support for all ES6 additions, and is quite quick. You can find a full list of options that can be passed to this adapter [here](https://babel.org/docs/usage/options/).

## Supported Methods

 - render

## Source Maps

Source maps are well supported by babel. Just pass in `sourcemap: true` as an option and you will get back `sourcemap` on the response object.
